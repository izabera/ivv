The Something Something IV&V Conformance Test Suite
===================================================

IV&V: Independent Verification and Validation

Tests are one of three approaches:

 - Assertions for each claim a standard makes.
   Each test is qualified with a reference to the standard.

   The idea is that for every sentence which mandates something,
   that behaviour is explicitly tested by breaking that sentence
   up into individual clauses and to assert on each in turn.

 - Fuzzing: Random permutations of valid input.
   Behaviour is compared against against a reference implementation.

 - Regression tests of situations encountered in practice.
   These typically involve behaviour between several items which
   individual tests cannot find.

   All regression tests provide a "workaround" to avoid that
   problem in production.
